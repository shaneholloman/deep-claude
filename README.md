  <code>deep-claude</code> points <a href="https://claude.com/claude-code">Claude Code</a> at DeepSeek's
  Anthropic-compatible endpoint and redirects its state into a private home, so your real
  Anthropic login is never touched. Type <code>deep-claude</code> followed by any normal
  <code>claude</code> arguments and you get the full agentic harness — tools, MCP, slash
  commands, sub-agents, the works — running on <code>deepseek-v4-pro</code>.
</p>

```console
$ deep-claude -p "refactor this module and run the tests"
…the Claude Code agent loop you know — planning, editing, running — on DeepSeek V4…

$ deep-cco --model flash -p "triage these failing tests"
…same thing, sandboxed, on the faster flash model…
```

## Why run DeepSeek in the Claude harness?

Claude Code is one of the best agentic coding harnesses there is: the planning loop, tool
use, MCP servers, sub-agents, permissions, and slash commands are all _harness_, not
_model_. DeepSeek's V4 models speak the Anthropic API, so you can keep every bit of that
machinery and just swap the brain.

- **Run real workflows, not just chat.** Multi-step edits, test loops, MCP tools, and
  sub-agents all work — DeepSeek V4 drives the same agent loop Claude Code gives you.
- **Genuinely strong at code.** V4-pro is sharp on reasoning, refactors, and long-context
  work; `flash` is fast and cheap for triage, scripting, and bulk passes.
- **Cost-effective.** Pay DeepSeek's API rates for heavy autonomous runs while keeping your
  Anthropic subscription pristine for everything else.
- **Zero contamination.** Session history, projects, MCP config, and `~/.claude.json` live
  in a private `.deep-claude-home/` — your normal Claude Code setup is untouched.
- **Sandbox on demand.** `deep-cco` runs the whole thing inside a real OS sandbox, so you
  can hand an agent `--dangerously-skip-permissions` without handing it your `$HOME`.

> **Your normal setup is safe.** The wrappers only set a few environment variables and
> redirect `$HOME` per launch. They never read, move, or modify your Anthropic credentials.

Two thin Bash wrappers:

| Wrapper      | What it does                                                                 | Extra dependency                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `deep-claude` | Runs `claude` against `api.deepseek.com/anthropic` with isolated state.     | none                                                   |
| `deep-cco`    | Same as `deep-claude`, but inside [nikvdp/cco](https://github.com/nikvdp/cco)'s sandbox. | [`cco`](https://github.com/nikvdp/cco) |

Both wrappers share the same state directory, so DeepSeek session history is consistent whether you run sandboxed or unsandboxed.

## Requirements

- **macOS or Linux**
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** — `claude` on `PATH`. Install via the [official installer](https://claude.com/claude-code) or `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`.
- **A DeepSeek API key** — sign up at [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/).
- **[nikvdp/cco](https://github.com/nikvdp/cco)** — **only** required for `deep-cco`. Install with:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikvdp/cco/master/install.sh | bash
  ```

`deep-cco` is installed by this repo's `install.sh` regardless of whether `cco` is present; it will refuse to start with a clear error if `cco` is missing at runtime.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dennisonbertram/deep-claude
cd deep-claude
./install.sh
```

This symlinks `deep-claude` and `deep-cco` into `~/.local/bin`. Make sure that directory is on your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Set your DeepSeek API key (Keychain is recommended on macOS — see all options below):

```bash
security add-generic-password -s deep-claude -a deepseek -U -w
# (paste the key, then return)
```

Run it:

```bash
deep-claude              # interactive session on deepseek-v4-pro
deep-cco                 # same, but sandboxed (requires cco installed)
```

## Configuring the API key

The wrappers look for `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in this order:

1. **Shell environment** — `export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="sk-..."`
2. **`.env` next to this repo** — `cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env`
3. **macOS Keychain** — `security add-generic-password -s deep-claude -a deepseek -U -w`

The literal placeholder `sk-...` (as committed in `.env.example`) is treated as **unset**, so a stale `.env` won't shadow a real Keychain entry.

### Keychain details (macOS)

- Service: `deep-claude` — Account: `deepseek`
- The `security` binary handles all reads, so the key never lives in `.env`, shell history, or process listings.
- The first read after a reboot may show a Keychain access prompt. Click **Always Allow** once and subsequent calls are silent.
- To rotate the key: re-run the `security add-generic-password` command (the `-U` flag updates in place).
- To inspect: `security find-generic-password -s deep-claude -a deepseek -w`
- To remove: `security delete-generic-password -s deep-claude -a deepseek`

### `.env` details

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (gitignored) and set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...`. You can also override the executables:

```bash
# Optional
CLAUDE_BIN=claude   # used by deep-claude
CCO_BIN=cco         # used by deep-cco
```

## Usage

### `deep-claude` — unsandboxed

```bash
deep-claude                                # interactive, deepseek-v4-pro (default)
deep-claude --model flash                  # deepseek-v4-flash
deep-claude --model deepseek-v4-pro        # full model name also works
deep-claude -p "hello"                     # non-interactive prompt
deep-claude --model flash -- -p "hello"    # -- stops deep-claude option parsing
```

Model aliases:

- `pro` → `deepseek-v4-pro` (default)
- `flash` → `deepseek-v4-flash`

All arguments other than `--model` pass straight through to `claude`. Use `--` to be explicit when `claude`'s own flags overlap with the wrapper's.

### `deep-cco` — sandboxed via [nikvdp/cco](https://github.com/nikvdp/cco)

Same wrapper, but everything runs inside `cco`'s sandbox (native: Seatbelt on macOS, bubblewrap on Linux; Docker as a fallback). Use this when you want the ergonomics of `--dangerously-skip-permissions` without exposing all of `$HOME` to a prompt-injectable agent.

```bash
deep-cco                       # sandboxed DeepSeek session
deep-cco --model flash
deep-cco --safe -p "hi"        # cco's experimental tighter sandbox (hides $HOME)
deep-cco -- -p 3000:3000       # pass args through to cco's underlying sandbox backend
```

`--model` is consumed locally; everything else flows to `cco` (and then to `claude` per cco's rules). See [cco's README](https://github.com/nikvdp/cco) for sandbox flags like `--safe`, `--add-dir`, `--allow-readonly`, and `--deny-path`.

## OpenRouter mode

`deep-claude --open-router` points Claude Code at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) instead of DeepSeek, so you can drive the same harness with Gemini, GPT, DeepSeek, Grok, Qwen, Claude, and anything else OpenRouter serves — including a curated `/model` picker and per-sub-agent model selection.

It works because OpenRouter exposes a **native Anthropic Messages endpoint** (`/api/v1/messages`) that accepts any model on the platform. A tiny local proxy (`bin/deep-router-proxy`, no dependencies beyond `node`) sits in front of it to (1) advertise only your curated model list to Claude Code's `/model` picker, and (2) strip the Anthropic-only `context_management` field that 400s on non-Claude models.

### Setup

Store your OpenRouter key (env, `.env`, or Keychain):

```bash
security add-generic-password -s deep-router -a openrouter -U -w   # macOS Keychain
# …or put OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... in .env
```

Curate the models you want to expose:

```bash
deep-router models add google/gemini-3.5-flash      gemini
deep-router models add anthropic/claude-opus-4.8    opus
deep-router models add deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash   deepseek
deep-router models default gemini
deep-router models list
```

(Model ids change over time — check [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models) for current slugs.)

### Use

```bash
deep-claude --open-router                          # uses ROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL
deep-claude --open-router --model opus             # by alias
deep-claude --open-router --model x-ai/grok-4.1    # or a full OpenRouter id
deep-claude --or -p "explain this repo"            # --or is shorthand
```

> **Non-Claude reasoning models:** OpenRouter's Anthropic skin injects (out-of-order) `redacted_thinking` blocks for models like Gemini, which would otherwise make Claude Code show an empty response. `deep-router-proxy` strips those blocks for non-`anthropic/` models so the visible text comes through; genuine Claude models pass through untouched. Disable with `ROUTER_KEEP_THINKING=1`.

Inside the session, `/model` lists exactly your curated set (via gateway discovery). And because a sub-agent's `model:` frontmatter accepts a full model id, a single workflow can run **many** OpenRouter models at once — the orchestrator on one model, sub-agents pinned to others.

### Curate

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `deep-router models add <id> [alias]` | Add an OpenRouter model id (optionally with a `--model` alias) |
| `deep-router models remove <id\|alias>` | Drop a model (removing an alias also drops its model) |
| `deep-router models default <alias\|id>` | Set the model used when `--model` is omitted |
| `deep-router models list` | Show the curated set, aliases, and default |
| `deep-router serve` | Run the proxy in the foreground (rarely needed; `--open-router` boots it for you) |

These edit `ROUTER_MODELS` / `ROUTER_ALIASES` / `ROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL` in `.env`.

> **Note:** OpenRouter recommends pinning the Anthropic first-party provider for genuine Claude models; non-Claude models work but won't honor Claude-only features like prompt caching.

## How it works

Both wrappers set the same environment variables:

```
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=<selected model>
```

…and redirect `HOME` plus the XDG `config`/`cache`/`data`/`state` directories into `<repo>/.deep-claude-home/`. Claude Code's state — session history, projects, MCP configuration, `~/.claude.json` — lives there instead of in your real `~/.claude/`. Your normal Anthropic Claude Code setup is untouched.

`deep-cco` inherits that redirected `$HOME` and then execs `cco`. cco's filesystem-detection logic uses `$HOME` to find Claude's config dir, so it auto-mounts the redirected `.deep-claude-home/home/.claude` as writable inside the sandbox. Namespace isolation survives the sandboxing layer.

## Troubleshooting

**`deep-claude: missing DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`**
No key found in shell env, `.env`, or Keychain. Set one (see [Configuring the API key](#configuring-the-api-key)). Common gotcha: a `.env` file containing the literal `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...` placeholder is treated as unset starting from `7629c8b` — if you're on an older version, replace `sk-...` with a real key or `rm .env`.

**`deep-cco: 'cco' is not on PATH`**
Install cco:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikvdp/cco/master/install.sh | bash
```

**`Missing required module: ~/.local/bin/lib/agents.sh`**
You're on a `deep-cco` version older than `1ebac2c` that doesn't resolve cco's symlinks before redirecting `$HOME`. `git pull && ./install.sh` to fix.

**Keychain prompt appears repeatedly**
Click **Always Allow** once. macOS pins the access ACL to the `security` binary, so subsequent reads are silent — even across reboots.

**`claude` not found inside the sandbox**
cco bundles its own `claude` install in Docker mode. For native sandboxing (Seatbelt / bubblewrap), make sure `claude` is installed on your host and on `PATH`.

**Argument passthrough confusion**
The wrappers eat `--model X` themselves. Everything else passes through. Use `--` to be explicit: `deep-claude --model flash -- -p "hello"` is unambiguous.

**Want to see what the wrapper would run without actually running it?**
Override the executable:
```bash
CLAUDE_BIN=/bin/echo deep-claude --model flash -p hi
# prints: --model deepseek-v4-flash -p hi
```

## Development

```bash
./test.sh
```

The tests use `CLAUDE_BIN=/bin/echo` and `CCO_BIN=/bin/echo` to verify argument passthrough without invoking real binaries. They cover:

- Bash syntax (`bash -n`) for every script
- Model alias resolution (`pro` / `flash` / explicit name)
- Argument passthrough (`-p`, `--output-format`, etc.)
- The `--` separator semantics
